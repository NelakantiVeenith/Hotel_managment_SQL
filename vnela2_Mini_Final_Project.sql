/* Creating all the required tables for Hotel Management */

/* this database is about hotel management system. It includes tables for guests, rooms, reservations, bookings, staff, departments, and payments.
guests table: This table contains information about the hotel's guests, including their unique guest ID, first name, last name, email address, phone number, address, city, state, and zip code.

rooms table: This table contains information about the hotel's available rooms, including the room number (which serves as the primary key), room type, price, availability status (which can be "Available", "Occupied", or "Maintenance"), bed type, and floor.

reservations table: This table tracks the reservations made by guests, including the unique reservation ID, the guest ID associated with the reservation (from the guests table), the room number associated with the reservation (from the rooms table), the check-in and check-out dates, and the total cost of the reservation.

bookings table: This table contains information about guest bookings, including the unique booking ID, the guest ID associated with the booking (from the guests table), the booking date, and the booking time.

staff table: This table contains information about the hotel's staff, including their unique staff ID, first name, last name, position, salary, phone number, and email address.

departments table: This table tracks the different departments within the hotel and assigns them unique department IDs.

payments table: This table contains information about guest payments, including the unique payment ID, the guest ID associated with the payment (from the guests table), the payment amount, payment date, and payment method.

All tables use primary keys to identify individual records, and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables, such as linking guest information in the reservations and bookings tables to the guests table.

/* This is a SQL code for creating a trigger named "update_amount". A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed in response to certain database events. In this case, the trigger is defined to be executed before a new row is inserted into the "reservations" table.

The trigger performs the following actions:

Declares two local variables, "num_days" and "total_cost", of type integer.

Calculates the number of days between the check-out date and check-in date of the new reservation, and stores the result in the "num_days" variable using the DATEDIFF function.

Calculates the total cost of the reservation by multiplying the number of days by the daily rate of $120, and stores the result in the "total_cost" variable.

Sets the "total_cost" value of the new reservation to the calculated value using the "NEW" keyword to refer to the newly inserted row.

The trigger is defined using the "BEGIN" and "END" keywords to enclose the trigger's code. The "DELIMITER" keyword is used to change the delimiter used by MySQL to the double slash "//" so that the code can be executed as a single statement.

/* This is a SQL code for creating a trigger named "zero_error". The trigger is defined to be executed before an update is made on the "reservations" table. The purpose of this trigger is to handle the scenario where the "total_cost" of a reservation is mistakenly set to 0.

The trigger performs the following actions:

Declares a local variable, "total_cost", of type decimal.

Checks if the "total_cost" value of the old row (i.e., the row being updated) is equal to 0.00 using an "IF" statement.

If the "total_cost" value of the old row is equal to 0.00, then the "SET" statement is executed to set the "total_cost" value of the new row (i.e., the updated row) to 120.00, assuming a daily rate of $120.

The trigger is defined using the "BEGIN" and "END" keywords to enclose the trigger's code.

The "DELIMITER" keyword is used to change the delimiter used by MySQL to the double slash "//" so that the code can be executed as a single statement. */
